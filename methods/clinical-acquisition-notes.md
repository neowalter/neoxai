# Clinical acquisition notes: filter phase and EDF time axes

Author: Jayson Leach, REEGT — practicing clinical EEG technologist
Context: lessons from building REACT EEG (live acquisition + review)

## 1. Causal vs zero-phase filtering: why live and reviewed traces differ

- Live acquisition can only filter causally (forward IIR). Zero-phase
  (filtfilt) needs future samples.
- Causal Butterworth adds frequency-dependent group delay: sharp transients
  (spikes, sharp waves) shift slightly and ring *after* the event.
- Zero-phase filtering preserves timing but rings symmetrically, so
  pre-ringing can appear *before* a spike, which can shift apparent onset
  timing.
- filtfilt squares the magnitude response: a "1 Hz LFF" is -6 dB at 1 Hz,
  not -3 dB. If the UI labels filters the way a clinical system does,
  compensate the design cutoff or document the mismatch.
- Streaming/worker implementations must carry filter state (zi) across
  chunks; otherwise each block boundary injects a small transient that
  looks like periodic artifact.
- MNE's default is zero-phase FIR; phase="minimum" gives a causal
  alternative. Know which one produced the trace you're reading.
- Rule: filtering is display-only. Store raw samples in the file.

## 2. EDF time axes: board timestamps vs sample count

- EDF has no per-sample timestamps: a header start time, fixed samples per
  data record, fixed record duration. The time axis is always rebuilt from
  sample count.
- Sample count x 1/fs, paced by the ADC crystal, is usually a better
  intra-record clock than host read timestamps, which carry SPI and
  scheduler jitter.
- The real failure mode is dropped samples (missed DRDY, socket
  backpressure). A count-based axis silently compresses the gap.
- Recommended: carry a sample/packet counter through the bridge, detect
  gaps on the receiving side, and write them as EDF+D (discontinuous,
  per-record onset) or at minimum an annotation. Use host wall-clock only
  to anchor start time and check drift.
